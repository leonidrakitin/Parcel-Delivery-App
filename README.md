# Parcel Delivery APP
[![Gradle](https://github.com/leonidrakitin/Parcel-Delivery-App/actions/workflows/ci-gradle-build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/leonidrakitin/Parcel-Delivery-App/actions/workflows/ci-gradle-build.yml)

This is my implementation of the test task with the following assignment:

> Youâ€™ll be expected to build the back-end of the web app, while the front-end will be built by another
developer in the team.
To do this, you are expected to implement a solution that enables the user stories provided. This solution
must be implemented as a microservice architecture that is deployable using container technology.

## SOLUTION DESIGN
![App design solution](images/solution.jpg)

## QUICK START

To begin, you need to build the project using Gradle:

```shell
./gradlew clean build
```

Now, you need to run the following command to launch the microservices in Docker:
```shell
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

To facilitate testing, I have prepared test data for you to authenticate as an administrator, 
which is available at the following path: `auth-server/src/main/resources/db/changelog/test_data.sql`.
Below, I am attaching credentials for **admin** user.
* **username**: admin
* **password**: password

Please keep in mind that you can use the following endpoints for user registration/login.

**POST** `/api/v1/auth/register`
```json
{
    "username": "username",
    "email": "email",
    "password": "password"
}
```
**POST** `/api/v1/auth/login`
```json
{
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password"
}
```

##### SPRING CLOUD CONFIG
By default, the **native** profile is used, but you can use either Vault or Git (https://github.com/leonidrakitin/parceldelivery-configs.git).
